# Daily Coding Problem
This repository contains my solutions to Challenges from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)

Every folder contains of 10 python file, one file one problem.
Moreover, there is sometimes additional code which is not an answer but is related :)
Finally, the purpose is learning so solutions are not always the most efficient.
